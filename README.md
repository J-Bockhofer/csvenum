# table2enum
csvenum? 


## WHat problem is this solving?


## Usage

Run or Add to project

Need to be able to put enums and structures as names into table,

Structure as Enum + const declarations per property + as and from fn per property + trait as and from Enum 

## Todos

1. descriptions for columns

2. print to console

3. impl wrapper for pure/movable functions

4. property type: Vec -> checking for duplicate values in table? [x]

5. property type: Fixed array [x]

5. Check duplicate values in consts ... are okay no? it only depends on what you call the function with, if country has 108 Citizens and 108mÂ² it is the same value but the meaning is different depending on context/ property name ... yes but if its the same property dingus lol [x]

6. Const property type: Regex, make r'' itself be a const &str that will then get passed to the regex constructor in the OnceLock (also need to cargo add regex, use regex::Regex)

7. Error in return types

8. impl Ord, Eq

9. nested containers? but then not as csv.. seems overkill.. but it will be done in the backend anyways [x]

10. impl std::fmt::Display on the enum

11. Get variant as name str for free

12. empty line in csv [x]

## Default Behaviour

4 space indent.

Single File

1. Enum Declaration (Variants)

2. Const Declaration (Property)

3. Converter Functions (as_Property, from_Property)

`Do not put any sensitive information in your table!`
The compiled binary will contain all the constants in a easily readable form.


## Ideas

1. Could define a trait too
    Say trait country with fn self_as_county() -> Option<Country>
    Makes it real easy to define a custom mapping to the associated constants.
    Just impl the trait, bam.

2. Merging of modified docs
    Simple...not: where mapping existed before, keep modification. new mapping integrate. keep all other modifications.
